Homework 3 - Feynman Writing Prompts
Objects
    Objects are variables that can contain a lot of data, functions, values, and properties together. 

Properties
    Properties keep or hold the data in an object.

Methods
    Methods are the functions in an object. They are the actions that can be performed on objects. 

For in loop
    The for in loop is able to run a piece of code for each property in an object by iterating over the properties. 

Dot notation vs. Bracket notation
    These notations are two different ways not accessing the properties of an object and also running a piece of code for each property. The bracket notation is used when the object doesnâ€™t have a valid variable name. If it does have a valid variable name, then dot notation can be used.
